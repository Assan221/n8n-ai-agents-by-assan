## AI Agents by Alimbay Assan

Hi! I’m a 18-year-old AI automation enthusiast from Almaty, Kazakhstan.  
This is a collection of AI-powered no-code agents I’ve built using [n8n](https://n8n.io).

They connect tools like:
- Telegram
- Gmail
- OpenAI
- Google Calendar
- Airtable
- and more...

## Why I built this

I believe AI + no-code = superpower.  
Even without programming skills, anyone can automate daily business processes using tools like n8n and APIs like OpenAI.

For me, this is not just a portfolio — it’s a learning journey.
